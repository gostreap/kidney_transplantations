\subsection*{Question 3}

Let $(k_1,t_1)$ be a pair of donor-patient and assume there is no cycle. Consider the chain starting from $(k_1,t_1)$. Since there is a finite number $n$ of donor-patient pairs and there is no cycle, the chain cannot be infinite. Finally, since the only way for a chain to stop is that $w$ belong to the chain, $(k_1,t_1)$ is indeed a tail of a $w$-chain.

Thus either there exists a cycle, or each pair is the tail of some $w$-chain.
